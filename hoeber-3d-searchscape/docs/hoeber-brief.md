# Briefing for Professor Orland Hoeber

## Concept bridge
- **Motivation:** Merge Hoeber’s 3D reconstruction expertise with my work on query-history modeling so past ideas become a spatial memory palace instead of a flat list.
- **Narrative:** Every query becomes a point in a temporal landscape. Topic intensity sculpts ridges, while engagement metrics lift promising explorations into peaks that demand attention.

## Experience walkthrough
1. **Python orchestration:** Structured logs (timestamp, topic, engagement) are cleaned, bucketed, and scored to produce a `scene.json` graph. Mock embeddings keep the format future-proof for neural topic work.
2. **Three.js rendering:** The frontend loads the scene, reconstructs a terrain strip (time on X, topic-lane on Z, engagement on Y), and drops orbitable query markers with hover tooltips.
3. **Analytical panels:** Side panels summarize ridge dominance, highlight temporal pivots, and let us focus on specific topic lanes (IR theory vs. HCI instrumentation vs. collaborative sensemaking).

## Hooks for Information Retrieval & HCI
- **Temporal IR analysis:** Peaks visualize when reformulation strategies or relevance-feedback experiments produced measurable engagement spikes.
- **Context-aware ranking research:** The timeline exposes when context-aware ranking signals (dwell, clicks) suggested re-ranking or personalization opportunities.
- **Human-centred visualization:** The spatial metaphor leverages embodied navigation—researchers orbit, zoom, and scrub the terrain to externalize their cognitive map.
- **Collaborative sensemaking:** Topic lanes become shared reference frames. Multiple analysts could pin annotations or trace session overlaps to align mental models.

## Future goals (focus for Prof. Hoeber)
1. **Live ridge morphing:** Stream active search sessions so the terrain grows in near-real time, spotlighting divergence between teams.
2. **Multi-user story layers:** Allow collaborators to paint semi-transparent layers over the same terrain, enabling “over-the-shoulder” insight sharing.
3. **Tactile/immersive probes:** Extend the scene to volumetric glyphs or VR gestures, echoing Hoeber’s historic work on volumetric sensemaking.
4. **Explainable retrieval cues:** Attach justificatory overlays (e.g., why a ridge rose) to link backend ranking decisions with a visual artifact—ideal for IR education.

## How to pitch it
“We are spatializing query history so that information retrieval strategies are visible as 3D ridges. Python distills logs into a scene graph; Three.js rebuilds a navigable landscape where IR metrics and HCI cues coexist. This prototype gives us a vehicle to study how analysts remember, revisit, and share search intent—opening a research thread directly in line with your fascination for 3D interaction and information visualization.”
